# Metro-Rail-Shehba
This app is a demo Android project, the work is not over yet. The idea of this android app comes to mind. According to the plan, MRTLINE-6 will be inaugurated for the first time in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. And it will cover about 16 stations, basically this app is ticketing, time schedule, GPS location to see where the train is, and ticket package system monthly, weekly, or half month. We know that Metro Rail is targeted for busy city working people so those who use Metro Rail every day for office can take advantage of the package and be free from the hassle of having to buy tickets again and again. If the package or ticket is deducted, the gate pass will be opened for the passenger by showing the QR CODE of the ticket in the scanner at the metro station. According to the idea, there will be an option of complaint box in which if any passenger encounters any problem, he can inform the authority through complaint box.
